		<h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>
		<aside>Really, it is.</aside>
	</header>
	<body>
	<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
	<p>You probably build website using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="mother">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link.</br>
	You thin you fucking default font is gonna make you website run even on a toaster.</p><br/>
	<p>
		<span class="wrong">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.
	</p></br>
	<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
		<p>Let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mother">motherfuckingwebsite></span>:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Shit's doesn's wrigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27,83KB cat picture below is remowed)</li>
		<li>The page weighs exactly 63,02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/"><span class="lien">Google home page</span></a></li>
		<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
		<li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
		<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it whithout any problem <span class="petit">well, kind of</span></li>
		<li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"><span class="lien"></span> accessible</span></a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span class="petit">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span></li>
		<li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style whithout looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"><span class="lien">ARPANET</a> website</li>
		<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"><span class="lien">IPoAC</a></li>
		<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <span class="petit"> which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li>
		<li>It doen's load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plan HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
		<li>Doesn't include any tracking service <span class="petit">this website does, but hey, who cares</li>
		<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <em>JUST USE IT</em>.</li>
		<li>Use <em>some</em>fucking <span class="arc">colors</span>.</li>
		<li>Links don't don't really need to keep that <span class="shitty">shitty blue</span>the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="violet">violetish color</span> when they are marked as visited. Juste give then a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa"><span class="nice">nice color</a></li>
	</ul>
		<h3>Well guess what, motherlover :</h3><br/>
			<p>This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="lien">guy</a>and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="lien">guy before him</span></a>.</p><br/>
		<p>Why?</p><br/>
	<ul>
		<li>It's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
		<li>It uses one of the most general gTLDs available out there: .website</li>
		<li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com/">domainr<span class="lien"></a> to do something cool too.</li>
		<li>It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" <span class="lien"></span>Lets'Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?)</li>
		

	</ul>
